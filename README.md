# AutoHotkeyScript
 An ahk script for improving keyboard layout and launching apps.
 _the RShift is a compromise because of the lack of Capslock on HHKB keyboard. It works better on other keyboard when using CapsLock as I'm concerned._


## Main functions
 1. Launch apps when there's no instance or top apps when there're some instances
 2. Simplify the workflow of Fastcopy by just one key. 
 3. Create a Layer-Changing key like fn to change layer for hhkb(double-click RAlt)
 4. Improve hhkb layout with setting del, direction key and so on.
 5. Provide some other hotkey like minimize, maximize, wheel up or down and so on.


## TODO
  a function to register the window of total commander
